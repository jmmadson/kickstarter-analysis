# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for a successful Kickstarter for her play, The Fever.
## Key Findings
* Accross the genres analyized, including film & video, food, games, journalism, music, photography, publishing, technology and theatre, theatre campaigns had the most successful kickstarters completed. Additionally, of those, plays had more successful, than non successful kickstarters. 
* The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were launched in May. The months of January, June, July and October saw almost as many failed as successful campaigns. 
* On average, failed kickstarter campaigns had higher goals than successful ones.
* The mean campaign goal for musicals in Great Britain is higher than the outlier data for pledged, so a campaign of £2000 may be more successful.
